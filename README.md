This project is a easy to use web application that lets the user search for shows, movies and actors. The application initially displays a blank Home Page with a search box, dropdown menu and a search button
where the user can pick between searching for movies/shows or actors. The webiste also features two buttons with two lists, 10 Most popular movies right now and 10 Top rated movies of all time.

The project was written in Visual Studio Code in three programming languages, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All the data on the page was fetched from "The Movie Database (TMDb)" using their API.

The whole project was a big challenge for me personally but if I'd had to pick a specific moment that was extra challenging then it most definitely has to be the search function. It was a huge challenge to make all the 
correct data show up on the page after respective search, at the start when the user searched for a movie or show and the name contained a word that was also located in an actors name, the application decided to only show me
the actor. 

The application is self explanatory and most users should have no trouble browsing the application.
